## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Footer Visibility Issue

**Challenge**: The footer was not visible on the home page due to layout issues.

**Solution**: Reordered elements in the app component to ensure proper layout structure:
- Navbar at the top
- Router outlet in the middle
- Footer at the bottom

### 2. Navbar Overlapping

**Challenge**: The navbar was overlapping with content due to fixed positioning.

**Solution**: Changed navbar positioning from fixed to sticky and added proper padding to content.

### 3. Form Validation

**Challenge**: Implementing comprehensive form validation with user-friendly error messages.

**Solution**: 
- Used Angular's built-in validators
- Implemented custom validation messages
- Added visual feedback for validation errors
- Created helper methods for error handling

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility

**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent appearance and functionality across different browsers.

**Solution**:
- Added CSS fallbacks for modern features
- Implemented vendor prefixes
- Created responsive design patterns
- Used feature detection for advanced capabilities

## Assumptions
